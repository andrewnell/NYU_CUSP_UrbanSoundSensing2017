# NYU_CUSP_UrbanSoundSensing2017
This lecture introduces students to the fundamentals and application of sensing urban sound.

Gathering and making use of data from these environments requires knowledge of real-time data acquisition techniques and considerations when capturing and visualizing acoustic data. Time and frequency domain visualization approaches will be introduced, facilitated by a data collection initiative based around a “smart” sound sensing tool.

Prerequisites

* Knowledge of data I/O using Python libraries
* Visualization and handling of large datasets
* Basic understanding of multithreaded scripting
