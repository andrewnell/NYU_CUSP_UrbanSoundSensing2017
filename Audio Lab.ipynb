    "* **\"smart\" alerts**. If you notice, the function fires an alert every single time the level exceeds the threshold. So if you were to scream into your microphone for a few seconds (NO SHAME), you'd notice that a long string of alerts would start to print out. Now if this was alerting me via slack or email, I'd be pretty ticked. So you could develop something that tracks whether the system is in an *alerted* state and only issues alerts when there is a new event. \n",
